# Problem Statement: Flutter App with User Data Input and Display

## Problem Statement
Design and develop a Flutter mobile application that facilitates user data input through a form. The application should gather essential user information, such as name and email address. Implement navigation using the Flutter `Navigator` framework to transition users to a new screen, which will display the data entered by the user upon form submission.

## Key Requirements
1. Create a user-friendly Flutter app with an intuitive interface that enables users to input their personal information.

2. The user input form should collect the following data:
   - Full Name (First Name and Last Name)
   - Email Address
   - Phone Number (optional, if relevant)
   - Date of Birth (optional, if relevant)
   - Gender (optional, inclusivity encouraged)
   - Address (if relevant for your app)
   - Profile Picture (if applicable)
   - Biographical Information (if relevant)
   - Username (if your app has social or community aspects)
   - Password (for account creation and security)
   - Security Questions (optional)

3. Ensure that the form includes appropriate validation to handle errors, such as invalid email formats or empty fields.

4. Implement proper navigation using the Flutter `Navigator` to transition from the input form screen to a new screen that displays the user-entered data.

5. Display the collected data on the new screen in a clear and organized manner. Ensure that the user can easily review the information they provided.

6. Include a mechanism for users to submit the form, triggering the navigation to the data display screen.

7. Apply Flutter best practices for UI/UX design and maintain code quality.

8. Test the application thoroughly to ensure it functions correctly, handles edge cases gracefully, and provides a seamless user experience.

9. Ensure that the app is compatible with various screen sizes and orientations.

## Optional Enhancements (if time allows)
1. Implement data persistence to store user information locally on the device.

2. Add additional input fields or features to enhance the app's functionality and user experience.

3. Incorporate animations or transitions to make the user interface more engaging.

4. Implement error handling and provide meaningful error messages to guide users in case of issues during form submission.

## Deliverables
1. Flutter application source code with proper comments and documentation.

2. Detailed documentation explaining how to run the application and navigate its features.

3. A brief report summarizing the development process, challenges faced, and future improvements or enhancements.

4. Presentation or demonstration of the Flutter app's functionality and user flow.

## Timeline
The project should be completed within the specified timeframe, taking into account any agreed-upon milestones or checkpoints.

## Success Criteria
The project will be considered successful if the Flutter app functions as described in the problem statement, meets all key requirements, and provides a user-friendly experience. Additionally, the code should be well-structured and maintainable.
